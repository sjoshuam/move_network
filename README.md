# move_network

IRS provides data showing how many people moves from each county to each county
for each year between 2011 and 2022. This project trains PyTorch
Geometric models to predict each year's flow, primarily using Census and
geographic characteristics.  See project milestones for a list of major
tasks.

I do projects like this to keep my skills sharp.  See the bottom section for
my practice goals.
