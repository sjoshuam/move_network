# move_network

IRS provides data showing how many people moves from each county to each county
for each year between 2011 and 2022. This project trains PyTorch
Geometric models to predict each year's flow, primarily using Census and
geographic characteristics.  See project milestones for a list of major
tasks.

I do projects like this to keep my skills sharp.  See the bottom section for
my practice goals.


## Project Milestones

TODO: Plan the project at a high-level


## Practice Goals

Develop software as constellations of containerized micro-services
- [X] Stand up a Docker container server on a standalone machine
- [ ] Host a container with a PyPI mirror for select packages
- [ ] Host a container with a Postgres database
- [ ] Host a container with a Neo4j database
- [ ] If time permits: Index databases with Elasticsearch

Process data using distributed approaches (use a mix of CPU & GPU)
- [ ] Refine data using PySpark
- [ ] Refine data using Dask
- [ ] Refine data using Multiprocessing + Python

Analyze graph data using graph and deep learning tools
- [ ] Analyze graphs with iGraph
- [ ] Model graphs with PyTorch Geometric

Present the results using visualization tools
- [ ] Build webpages with Plotly figures
- [ ] Build dashboards with Tableau + TabPy
