# move_network

IRS provides data showing how many people moved between counties
for each year between 2011 and 2022. This project examines movement
patterns, projects future trends and infers policy recommendations.

The project is in its early stages.  Currently writing the basic ETL
script.

UPDATE:  Major reorganization in progress!!   Code is temporarily broken...
