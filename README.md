# move_network

IRS provides data showing how many people moved between counties
for each year between 2011 and 2022. This project examines movement
patterns, projects future trends and infers policy recommendations.

I've structured this project to meet all of my 2025 skill development
goals.  This [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/sjoshuam/projects/3)
tracks the planned work items in the plan.  The list below summarizes
the plan's four major objectives:

0. Ensure that the project meets all training goals, and is packaged
to enable easy orchestration and start-to-finish execution with few
commands. Python, Prefect.
1. Stand up a constellation of containerized micro-services to support
the project, mimicking a production server environment as closely as
practical. Key tools: Unix Shell, Podman, Postgres, Neo4j.
2. Acquire and refine data. Practice doing distributed data processing
using several different approaches.  Key tools: PySpark, Dask.
3. Analyze, model, and predict movement between US counties over time.
Practice using graph analytics and deep learning to gain insights. Key
tools: iGraph, PyTorch Geometric.
4. Communicate findings and recommendations using several different
information dashboard approaches. Practice visualizing data and making
technically-derived insights intuitive.  Key tools:  Plotly, HTML,
Tableau, TabPy, Nginx.
